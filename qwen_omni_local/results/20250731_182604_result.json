When I first arrived in the United States, I was quite nervous about speaking English with native speakers. However, I quickly realized that most people are very patient and understanding. I made many friends who helped me practice my English, and I also joined several conversation groups at my university. This experience taught me that immersion is one of the best ways to learn a language.",
